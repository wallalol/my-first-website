<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가</h2>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/index.html" 
target="blank" title="html speification link">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard Markup
language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
<br><br>
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage 
and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
<br><br>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms 
may be embedded into the rendered page. <p style="margin-top: 40;">
<img src="coding.jpg" width="100%"> <br>
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural 
semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, 
and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using 
angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce 
content into the page.</p>
